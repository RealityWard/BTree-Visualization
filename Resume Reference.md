# Summary
This is my capstone project made with a team. I coordinated who worked on what for this project using Agile methodology while simultaneously coding the backend logic for a BTree data structure. The original goal was to create an animated visual of the basic operations of a BTree data structure using C\#. Ideally the application creates a real B Tree object and anounces key actions to the frontend to enable visual updating each step for the 'animation'.
