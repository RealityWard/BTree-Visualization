# B-Tree and B+Tree-Visualization
Welcome to the B-Tree and B+Tree Visualization project! This repository hosts a collaborative effort to implement visually engaging and interactive visualizations of B-Tree and B+Tree structures. The goal is to provide a comprehensive learning resource for understanding these fundamental data structures. This project is implemented as the CS4488 Capstone Project at Idaho State University.

# Project Overview

# What are B-Trees and B+Trees?
B-Trees and B+Trees are self-balancing tree data structures widely used in databases and file systems for efficient storage and retrieval of data. This project aims to create intuitive visualizations that showcase the dynamic behavior of these trees during various operations such as insertion, deletion, and search.

# Features
- Visualize B-Tree and B+Tree operations
- Allow user selection of the degree of the tree for B+Tree
- Differentiate between non-leaf and leaf nodes
- Animated representation of changes during tree operations

# Project Structure
- /src: Contains the source code for the B-Tree and B+Tree visualizations.
- /docs: Documentation files, including user guides and developer documentation.
- /tests: Unit tests for ensuring the reliability of the implementations.
